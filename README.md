# Bioinformatics & Data Science Projects

This repository brings together my first steps and ongoing work in data science applied to biological and health problems.  
My goal is to understand how data can be used to improve research in immunology, virology, and vaccine development — connecting analytical thinking with scientific curiosity.

Here I’ll be uploading exercises, experiments, and small projects built with tools like **EpiData**, **R**, **Orange**, and **Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib)**.  
Each project reflects a different phase of my learning process, from simple data cleaning to the creation of predictive or visual models related to public health and bioinformatics.

This space will keep evolving as I gain more experience in programming and research.  
In the future, I aim to explore topics such as **epidemiological modeling**, **genomic analysis**, and **data-driven vaccine design**.
